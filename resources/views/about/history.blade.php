                            <strong>PT. Performa Inti Nusantara</strong> began its journey in 2005 as a small team of developers focused on creating inventory and accounting software for small and medium-sized businesses. With a strong commitment to quality and client satisfaction, the company quickly gained recognition and expanded its range of services.

                            As the demand for customized software grew, we ventured into developing industry-specific solutionsâ€”ranging from hospital information systems and electronic medical records (eMR) to retail, logistics, and human resource applications.

                            In 2017, to further strengthen our legal standing and professional identity, we officially established the business as a limited liability company under the name <strong>PT. Performa Inti Nusantara</strong>. This transformation marked a new chapter in our growth, enabling us to serve a broader market and scale our innovations.

Our journey continues with a vision to lead in the field of information systems and digital transformation.
